# Steganography
- **Development**: Aug 2024 - Aug 2024 
- Steganography hides secret messages within ordinary files like text, images, or audio to avoid detection. Derived from Greek steganos (hidden) and graph (writing), it conceals data in non-secret media, such as embedding text in a document or picture. Unlike encryption, it focuses on hiding the existence of the message itself.
